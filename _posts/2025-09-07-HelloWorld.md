Another hello world article, as I recently started over with my blog.  
I lost a couple of outdated articles, but I donÂ´t care about it.

Updating the several years old theme, I run into issues and decided to try out something new.

After asking Google Gemini (which is to date still the best option to use AI on a free plan)  
I tried out [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter).

By the way - the last re-launch of my private webpage was without any AI help.  
This really makes a **huge** difference in research and troubleshooting.

Might be a good follow-up post: How AI changed my "learning by doing" approach :)

See you soon!
