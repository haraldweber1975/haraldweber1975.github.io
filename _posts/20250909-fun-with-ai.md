# Tldr;

# Gather some knowledge?
I will skip this part, as I already knew that...
* Github Paes offers a free of charge possibility to host your own website
* you need to be familiar with jekyll and know what gibhub pages supports

But starting like "Show me free options to host a simple website" should lead you to Github and specifically to Github Pages.

# Choosing the right template
Asking for a nice, dark themed Github Pages template, Chirpy is the first option presented by Gemini.
Look no further ;)

# Where to start
Chirpy does a great job in bootstrapping the whole system to your own github repository.  
This is the process:

* Login to Github
* Open the Chripy-Start page
  * Enter the repository name
  * Optionally add your own domain to github pages
* Modify the _config.yml file

If you´re doing the whole editing directly in GitHub Pages, you should be aware that there´s a delay of approx 10 Minutes from changing a file to "seeing it live in the web".  
The build process on GitHub Pages is pretty quick, but that does not mean that your changes are "live" already.  
Be patient! :)

# Create a favicon

# set your own avatar

# Create a "Hello world! article"

# Updating the template??
This is something I didn´t check ´till now.
