# Tldr;

# Gather some knowledge?
I will skip this part, as I already knew that
a) Github Paes offers a free of charge possibility to host your own website
b) you need to be familiar with jekyll and know what gibhub pages supports

But starting like "Show me free options to host a simple website" should lead you to Github and specifically to Github Pages.

# Choosing the right template

# Where to start

# Create a favicon

# set your own avatar

# Create a "Hello world! article"

# Updating the template??
This is something I didn´t check ´till now.
